      <h1>Remembering Arron Wernimont</h1>
      <h2>My family would like to thank you all for coming.  The tremendous support, kind words and comfort have really been overwhelming.  The sheer number of people in attendance here today is a testament to how special Aaron was, how many lives he touched, and the loving and supportive community we are blessed to be a part of.  You have lifted us up in this difficult time.</h2>

        <p>As I was driving to Pocahontas to be with my family I had some time to think about what good could come of this and what Aaron would want us to focus on.   My brother’s death is a reminder of how delicate and fleeting life can be and that we are not guaranteed tomorrow.  Aaron was an example of living life to the fullest that we can all emulate.  I think he would want us to renew our resolve to live life everyday as if it could be our last.  Let us be reminded to take nothing for granted and most importantly appreciate and value the people in our lives that matter the most and to let them know it.  By doing so we honor Aaron. </p>
        <p>To Kahri, Aaron loved you wholeheartedly and was never afraid to express that.  As an older brother, I learned a lot about selfless love from watching him with you.  As was always true of Aaron, there were no pretenses or games, just genuine love.  Although your time with him was cut short, you can be comforted in knowing that you found a love that some search for their entire lives and never attain.  You will forever be a part of our family, and when Aaron married you I gained another sister.  One I could actually stand…<p>
